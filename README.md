A repo to help me practice version control and full stack JS

This application compiles scss, client side and server side js files.

it takes advantage if React, React Router, Redux. it runs an express server and has plenty of room for improvement

"npm i" wasnt installing devDependencies so package.json needs reviewed - could have been a local node environment issue
