A repo to help me practice version control and full stack JS

_"npm i" wasnt installing devDependencies so package.json needs reviewed - could have been a local node environment issue. currently all dependencies - including webpack - are in the dependencies property of package.json_

## List of tech used (not extensive)
 - [ ] webpack html extract thing (replace current template setup)
 - [ ] hashed filenames
 - [ ] Service Worker (in progress)
 - [ ] ejs / jade
 - [ ] lazy load routes
 - [ ] some DB (mongo?)
 - [x] Webpack
 - [x] Babel (es6)
 - [x] scss
 - [x] React
 - [x] Redux
 - [x] Router
 - [x] Isomorphic
 - [x] Express (nodemon for dev)
 - [x] production build config
 - [x] manifest.json
